<p>Reddit comments will no longer be stuck in whatever thread and subreddit that they were first posted in.Reddit now provides the ability to take comments from any public subreddit and embed them elsewhere online, allowing people to highlight specific comments and conversations.Twitter has allowed this for a long time now, and Facebook started allowing it a little over a year back.In both cases, theyve been important for anyone writing a news story, a blog post, or even a comment to articulate and frame conversations happening online, especially since those conversations are increasingly — if not predominantly — taking place on social media.Embedded comments may give Reddit a bigger presence in online conversations, for better or worse.</p>
