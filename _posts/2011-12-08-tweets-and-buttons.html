<p>Today weâ€™re launching a new version of Twitter that makes it even easier to stay close to everything that interests you.Were also excited to introduce new tools that bring Tweets to your website, and new ways to share with our Tweet buttons.Embedding a Tweet   
        Every Tweet has a story thats more than just 140 characters.It has an author, mentions @people and #topics, contains media, and has actions you can use to share or join the conversation.Its a dynamic piece of media, and we believe that everyone should be able to view and interact with Tweets on the Web in the same ways you would from any Twitter client.</p>
