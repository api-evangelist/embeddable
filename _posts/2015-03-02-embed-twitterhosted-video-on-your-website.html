<p>With the new embedded video widget, you can highlight Twitter-hosted video on your website, enhanced by the same JavaScript used to render Tweet buttons and embedded Tweets.Video embeds are available for videos captured and uploaded through Twitter’s applications for iOS and Android as well as Twitter Amplify partners.To embed a video on your website, get started by clicking on ••• in a Tweet and then selecting “Embed Video” (as seen in the example below).Next, copy and paste the generated HTML markup on your website to display a video-focused embed.The video widget displays the full, original Tweet when a viewer selects the Twitter logo.</p>
