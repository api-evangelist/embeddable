<p>GeoIQ provides a platform for uploading and download data, searching for data within maps and building, embedding, and theming maps or charts in your web sites and applications.GeoIQ is the engine that powers the attractive looking and powerful GeoCommons mapping community.The GeoIQ API provides both a REST API and a JavaScript API, enabling developers to:
Upload data and register web feeds
Manage, update, and delete datasets
Download datasets
Search for data and maps
Create maps and style layers
Embed maps and charts into websites
Create, update and delete users
Create groups and add or remove users
Set access permissions for viewing, downloading, or editing resources
The combination of a JavaScript API and REST API gives developers a lot of control over the mapping features in their web and mobile apps.You can quickly embed and display using JavaScript while also programmatically control every aspect of your mapping resource with the REST API which provides data in Atom, CSV, SON, KML and XLM formats.GeoIQ is definitely an essential addition to the local, mobile stack–I see it providing a utility you can use to deliver custom and robust mapping solutions for your mobile and web applications.</p>
