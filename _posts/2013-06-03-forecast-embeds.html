<p>We’ve received a bunch of requests from users who want a simple, attractive, weather widget that can be easily embedded on their websites.So today we’re releasing the first Forecast Embed, a concise little display of current conditions, the weekly forecast, and weather alerts (if any) for whatever location you specify.See the example above.It’s easy to use.Just plop this code into your HTML:
  The embed takes a few parameters (marked in red): the longitude and latitude of the point you want the forecast for, the name of the location as you want it to appear at the top of the embed, and the width of the embed (which can either be in pixels or percentage).</p>
