<p>Looking to make it simpler for developers to find and reuse components to build applications, Salesforce today launched an online Heroku Elements marketplace on top of its platform-as-a-service (PaaS) environment.Craig Kerstiens, product lead for the Heroku ecosystem, says that while Heroku has opened other online marketplaces, Heroku Elements is designed to provide a unified marketplace through which developers can access and sell preintegrated application components.Rather than building every application from scratch, developers more frequently are composing applications using preconfigured components residing on the Heroku PaaS running in the cloud, Kerstiens says.Each component, library and pattern stored in Heroku Elements can be installed via a single click using Heroku Buttons technology that Heroku created to simplify component integration within its PaaS environment.At the moment, Salesforce says there are 1,500 partners and developers creating components that reside on the Heroku PaaS.</p>
