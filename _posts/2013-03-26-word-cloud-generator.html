<p>As word placement can be quite slow for more than a few hundred words, the layout algorithm can be run asynchronously, with a configurable time step size.This makes it possible to animate words as they are placed without stuttering.It is recommended to always use a time step even without animations as it prevents the browserâ€™s event loop from blocking while placing the words.This is how the layout above is configured: var fontSize = d3.scale.</p>
