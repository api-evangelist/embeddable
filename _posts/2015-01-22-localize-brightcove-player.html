<p>In this topic you will see how to localize Brightcove Player.This is, literally, hard to see as the names of the control elements do not appear as you hover over them.The localized names of the control elements would be used by a screen reader though.In this document you will use the players HTML structure to confirm the elements names have be localized.First the process for localizing the In-Page Embed implementation is shown, then the iframe implementation.</p>
