<p>Real estate brokers and agents reel in many of their online leads by offering features like home valuation and listing search tools on their websites, often gating such tools behind registration forms.Now there’s another lead-capture feature in the works that may begin popping up on real estate websites later this year: virtual open houses — live video walk-throughs of listings.Realync, an app designed to support virtual open houses, is hard at work building an API (application programming interface) that could allow real estate websites to embed them on their websites.Keller Williams recently used Twitter to predict that such technology will take off in 2015.Realync offers several advantages over other live video apps like FaceTime, Skype and Google Hangouts.</p>
