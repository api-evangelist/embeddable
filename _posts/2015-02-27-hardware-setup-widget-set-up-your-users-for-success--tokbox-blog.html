<p>We’ve all experienced video calls where our hardware hasn’t performed as expected – whether video didn’t display, or audio input levels were too low, it can lead to frustration.With our new Hardware Setup Widget, we’re aiming to solve that problem.Now you can set your users up for success by enabling them to test their camera and microphone settings before their call begins.On top of that, settings can be saved so that any future conversations will get off on the right foot.The Hardware Setup widget works with OpenTok.</p>
