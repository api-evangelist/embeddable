<p>As applications developed with HTML5 increases, developers tend to face the initial obstacle that their applications may be constrained by the browsers at which they are accessed through.The Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) is an open source project that allows for a desktop application to support HTML5 features and plugins in web browser controls that are similarly supported by Google* Chrome.Chromium Embedded Framework is also available for use on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X systems.C/C++ is the programming languages that CEF is developed with via native libraries based on your platform of choice.There are two distinct versions of the framework that are currently maintained.</p>
