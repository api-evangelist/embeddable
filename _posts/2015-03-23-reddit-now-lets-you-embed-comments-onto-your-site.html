<p>Reddit can be a goldmine of memes and grassroots news, so the platform is today making it easier to share comments on on other sites with embeddable comments.Rather than copy, pasting and formatting text, you can now embed a small window into your blog or website to link towards comments.To generate the necessary code simply click on a comment’s permalink page, then select ‘embed’ to generate the code you need to copy.You also have the option to include parent comments.Reddit says the embeds will display any edits to the original posts however, so if you want to share something potentially time sensitive or that’s likely to be deleted, you’re still better off copying the text or just capturing a screengrab.</p>
