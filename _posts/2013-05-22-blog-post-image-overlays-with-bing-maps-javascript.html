<p>There are a lot of different types of data that can be overlaid on top of Bing Maps.In this post, we are going to look at how to overlay images on top of the Bing Maps V7 AJAX and Windows Store JavaScript controls.Over the years, Iâ€™ve seen a lot of great use cases for overlaying images on top of the map.Some of the more common use cases include: floor plans, satellite imagery of hurricanes or other natural disasters, historic maps, and other maps,
  There are two main approaches for overlaying images on Bing Maps.The first approach is to turn the image into map tiles ahead of time and serve them up to the application as a custom tile layer.</p>
