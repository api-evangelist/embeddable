<p>Tuesday, July 9th, 2013 at 9:43 pm			  				    			  				Pestered by my colleague Jason Weathersby (“you should have a share button on your blog, I don’t want to copy and paste the title and the URL”) I just added a “share on Twitter” button at the end of all my posts here on the blog.I looked at a few plugins and the official buttons and was not impressed as they all meant a lot of external JS and CSS and HTTP requests.That is not needed.So here is a Twitter Share button without any extra resources from the outside.The structure of a “share on Twitter” URL is http://twitter.</p>
