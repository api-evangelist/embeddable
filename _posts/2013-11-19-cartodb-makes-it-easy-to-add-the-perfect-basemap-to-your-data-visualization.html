<p>For the past two years the CartoDB team has focused largely on bringing you a powerful service for creating interactive data visualizations and projects built around dynamic and responsive data.It means we haven’t done a whole lot in the realm of basemaps.In fact, we haven’t really needed to since high quality basemaps keep coming from other groups such as MapBox and Stamen.Recently though, we thought it would be helpful for CartoDB users to have basemaps available that were designed to display behind other data visualization.Last week we rolled out three new basemaps in every user’s account, CartoDB Light, CartoDB Dark, and CartoDB Flat Blue.</p>
