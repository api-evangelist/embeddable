<p>Hello again!This post is set to continue the discussion on web components (started on the first web component post) 
Web components are the website building blocks that APIs were promised to be.The Pearson developer relations team thought that it would be best to learn by doing, and try out some of our APIs in the context of web components.In this use case we used Googleâ€™s Polymer platform to cut our teeth with web components.Polymer allows you to create and style custom elements and add them to your projects with just HTML, just like the standard 
<a> or 
<img> tags.</p>
