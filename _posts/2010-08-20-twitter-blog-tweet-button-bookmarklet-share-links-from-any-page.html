<p>Last week, we announced an easy-to-install and lightweight Tweet Button that allows publishers to make it easy for users to share a link to their content on Twitter.Thousands of sites have implemented the Tweet Button already.But what if you go to a site that doesn’t have a Tweet Button?Have no fear.Today, we’re making available a Tweet Button Bookmarklet that allows you to tweet a link with your own commentary from anywhere on the web.</p>
