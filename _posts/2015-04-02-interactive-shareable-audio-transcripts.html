<p>Learn how you can expose audio to new audiences – and new search engines – with our improved embeddable transcripts.On any public Pop Up Archive item page, the “Embed Codes” button lets you choose the embed code of your choice (read about the differences).If your site is oEmbed-enabled (such as through this WordPress plugin), these transcript players help search engines reliably crawl your transcripts like any other text.Paste the code you want into your site’s HTML.You can also add the transcript player to blog platforms like Tumblr (using their HTML editor) and WordPress (using an HTML embed plugin like this).</p>
