<p>See the functional form-embedded ad below.Whether theyre used to capture lead information, solicit feedback, or simply log in, forms are one of the most commonly-implemented features on Websites.But since directing users to a microsite to fill out a form interrupts their site browsing experience, advertisers have increasingly looked to instead embed forms directly within the ad itself.Without having to abandon the site users are more likely to fill out the form, improving response rate and obviating the need for building a landing page.While form widgets for use on blogs and other site pages have been common for years, embedded forms in ads are a relatively new feature of paid media publishing, and require a bit more sophisticated coding on the backend.</p>
