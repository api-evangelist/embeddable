<p>Last month we announced our newly revamped documentation, with full-text search in the sidebar and thousands of tweaks.Today were putting the docs in your hands.Linus Torvalds famously said that Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.Thats just as true for documentation as it is for code.Thats why weve made the raw reStructuredText markup behind our docs publicly available at https://github.</p>
