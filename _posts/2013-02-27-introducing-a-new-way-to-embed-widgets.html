<p>Today, we’re pleased to announce enhancements to how you embed widgets on your website. Before I dive into the details, let me start with a quick overview of key takeaways:
 The new widget environment provides an improved interface and changes how code is embedded on your site.The Feedback Widget is now named the Classic Widget.Widget settings are no longer saved in the UserVoice admin console.Your existing widgets will continue to work but can no longer be edited, nor will they be visible in your admin console.</p>
