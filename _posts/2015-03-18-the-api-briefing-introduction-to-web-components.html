<p>Instead of writing about a specific federal API this week, I want to talk about a new, evolving way of building Web interfaces and complete applications.Web Components allow developers to create their element that extends the HTML5 set of tags.Developers can create a Web Component that is a button that performs a specific function, such as composing and sending an email.Alternatively, a Web Component can be a complete application that a developer can easily drop into a Web page or mobile app.Developers can do that now just by using JavaScript libraries such as jQuery or Bootstrap and swapping code through GitHub.</p>
