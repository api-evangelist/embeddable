<p>In a small improvement to your admin console, we’ve added HTML formatting for your ticket responses.Bold important items, insert headers for those multipart tickets, add lists – you know, HTML stuff!Hopefully this improvement will help you craft better, clearer ticket responses to keep your customers happy.As always, let us know if you have any feedback!Our Associate Community Manager, Carter Gibson, manages UserVoice’s feedback forums, collecting and sharing customers’ ideas with the company and helping users understand our goals.</p>
