<p>You have to look hard for a company that makes cooler software than Panic.At least if you’re a Mac user, titles like Coda, Prompt, and Transmit should ring a bell.Panic’s latest app is Status Board.It turns your iPad into a highly customizable dashboard.There are many widgets that come with the app, including a clock, a calendar, email, Twitter, RSS, and more.</p>
