<p>Design is a universal concept.As the act of “form[ing] a plan or scheme of [some thing]… for later execution,” (Oxford English Dictionary) design is the common thread that weaves together art, architecture, hardware and more.Software design, specifically the subcategory of API design, is no different.Yet API design is often given little attention in the world of software development, because the exercise of writing code for other developers often seems far less important than the design of application UI and end-user experiences.But API design—the public interfaces we provide in the libraries we create, with the express intent of exposing features and functionality to developers who call our code—is just as important as UI design.</p>
