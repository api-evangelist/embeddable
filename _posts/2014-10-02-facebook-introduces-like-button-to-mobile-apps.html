<p>Gigaom 							Newsletters 				 							Dont miss out.Sign up to get all the news you need delivered right to your inbox.Facebook’s “Like” button has gone native on mobile.As of Thursday, Android and iOS developers are able to add it inside their apps, giving users the ability to “like” an article, the app itself, certain content within the app, or the app’s Facebook page.Those likes will then appear on the user’s Facebook profile the same way their desktop browser “likes” do.</p>
