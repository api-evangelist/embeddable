<p>If you’re eating at a restaurant and there’s something wrong with your meal, what do you do?You don’t get up and walk into the kitchen—you stay in your seat, talk to your waiter, and it’s taken care of.Why should customer service online be any different?Why should you have to exit your mobile app or video game or web page and go somewhere else if you need help or have a question?It’s not that consumers are lazy—we’re just busy, and we want to get the assistance we need in context, right where and when we need it.</p>
