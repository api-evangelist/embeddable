<p>It is not easy! Holding true to our mission of making nutrition information more accessible,  we are releasing what we hope to be the first of many open-source tools to help developers and food brands share nutrition data.Automatically calculate the Daily Value % based on a customizable recommended daily calorie intake (not limited to just 2000!)
 
The possibilities are endless. We will continue improving the label, but we would love to hear your input and feature requests via the GitHub issues tracker.</p>
