<p>Google on Friday announced the launch of a photo sphere viewing widget that you can embed in any website.This is a big change, as it means 360 degree panoramic images taken with Android devices are no longer limited to just Google’s services.For those who don’t know, Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) features a photo sphere camera that lets you snap photos in any direction and piece them together into what the company calls “photo spheres.” You can then view these on your phone, share them to Google+, add them to Google Maps, and now also anywhere else on the Web.</p>
