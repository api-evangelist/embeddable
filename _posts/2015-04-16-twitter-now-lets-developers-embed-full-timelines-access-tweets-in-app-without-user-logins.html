<p>Back in October, Twitter revealed Twitter Kit as a platform to help developers integrate Twitter features into their apps.One of the most useful features was direct support for tweet embeds, and the company now wants to make these more powerful.Starting today, developers can integrate full tweet timelines from any Twitter account into theirs apps “with just a few lines of code.” This should save developers time, who would often have to embed multiple tweets into an app manually or gain access to Twitter’s Curator tool.The background and text colors are customizable, so it can match your apps color scheme.</p>
