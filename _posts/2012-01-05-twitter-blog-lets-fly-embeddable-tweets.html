<p>Tweets have become one of the most important — and simplest — ways for people to share news, humor, inspiration, and knowledge online.And they are even richer when they include pictures, videos, locations, or links to other sites on the web.With the new version of Twitter, anyone can embed Tweets simply by copying and pasting one line of code into their website.Embedded Tweets automatically open to show images, conversations and videos.Whenever you see a Tweet embedded in a web page, you can follow that user with a single click and reply, retweet or favorite the Tweet right from the page.</p>
