<p>I’m at the DML Conference 2013 this week where, I’m delighted to say, Mozilla is launching version 1.0 of the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI).Given how long I’ve been banging on about badges this may seem surprising, but it just goes to show the extent to which Mozilla works in the open with the community!You should check out the newly-redesigned website and badge backpack (note new URL for latter now it’s out of beta!) I don’t usually do this, but I believe the text below put together by our new Communications Director Erica Sackin  puts things way better than I could: Open Badges is a new online standard to recognize and verify learning.</p>
