<p>Nine months ago we released Heroku Connect, the bi-directional data synchronization service that enables developers to build Heroku apps that seamlessly interact with Salesforce data.Since then, we’ve seen developers use it to build all types of interesting apps for web and mobile, especially for eCommerce, loyalty, and Internet of Things use cases.We’ve also seen an avalanche of requests from every corner of the Salesforce ecosystem for a simple and free way to try Heroku Connect, and explore new use cases.Today we are announcing the availability of Heroku Connect Demo Edition, a free version of Heroku Connect designed for learning and experimentation but not production.With Demo Edition, engineers evaluating new architectural options and developers building proof-of-concept apps can validate Heroku Connect as their choice through hands on product experience.</p>
