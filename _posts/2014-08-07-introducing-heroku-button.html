<p>At Heroku, we want to make the process of deploying, running and updating code simple and easy.To that end, weâ€™re launching the Heroku Button: a simple HTML or Markdown snippet that can be added to READMEs, blog posts and other places where code lives.Clicking a Heroku Button will take you through a guided process to configure and deploy an app running the source code referenced by the button.The best way to understand the Heroku Button is to try one.Click the example button below to deploy a Node.</p>
